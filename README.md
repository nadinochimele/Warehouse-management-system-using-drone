# Warehouse-management-system-using-drone
The project involves the development of a comprehensive warehouse management system (WMS) that integrates drone technology for various tasks within the warehouse environment
    Key functionalities include drone-based inventory management, real-time tracking of goods, automated stock replenishment, and efficient order picking and fulfillment.
    The system will utilize drones equipped with advanced sensors, cameras, and navigation technology to navigate through the warehouse, scan barcodes, and RFID tags, and communicate with the central WMS.
    Through intelligent route planning and optimization algorithms, the system will minimize drone travel time, reduce human intervention, and maximize warehouse throughput.

Goals and Objectives:

    Improve Warehouse Efficiency: Reduce manual labor and operational costs by automating routine tasks such as inventory counting, stock replenishment, and order fulfillment.
    Enhance Inventory Accuracy: Achieve real-time visibility into inventory levels, locations, and movements to minimize stockouts, overstocking, and discrepancies.
    Optimize Space Utilization: Utilize drones to monitor warehouse layout, identify storage optimization opportunities, and dynamically adjust inventory placement based on demand patterns.
    Increase Operational Agility: Enable quick adaptation to changing demand and operational requirements by leveraging flexible drone-based logistics solutions.
    Ensure Safety and Compliance: Implement robust safety protocols, collision avoidance mechanisms, and regulatory compliance measures to ensure safe and legal drone operations within the warehouse
